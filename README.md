This is basically a way to use Gorlem's Wiki on MacroMod (all commands, variables, iterators, parameters, etc.) without needing to go to your browser.

This script was developed to be used through Macro KeyBind Mod (by Mumfrey) â†’ Minecraft 1.12.1 or 1.12.2

Running the file for the first time will load everything and save this information. It will check if the information needs to be updated or not only once a day, hence it will load instantly after the first time you run it in the day, and won't need to anything more than 2-3 seconds if the API had no updates.
