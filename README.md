# Ingame WIKI for MacroMod
### Ingame Macro KeybBind mod wiki, using GORLEM's API.  
This is basically a way to use Gorlem's Wiki on MacroMod (all commands, variables, iterators, parameters, etc.) without needing to go to your browser.


This script was developed to be used through **Macro KeyBind Mod** (by Mumfrey) â†’ Minecraft 1.12.1 or 1.12.2
* Mod: https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1275039-macro-keybind-mod
* Liteloader: https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1290155-liteloader

Modules needed:
1. **Klacaiba**, by Spthiel: https://spthiel.github.io/Modules/?name=Klacaiba
2. **HTTP**, by xaero_: https://spthiel.github.io/Modules/?name=HTTP

Running the file for the first time will load everything and save this information. It will check if the information needs to be updated or not only once a day, hence it will load instantly after the first time you run it in the day (and this daily delay should not be more than 2 seconds if the API had no updates. I say approximatedly 2 seconds because it's the time it takes to make an http-request and get the response from the server).
